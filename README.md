# Mask
For this project we used p5.js in combination with the tensorflow.js library to create a digital mask self portrait. This piece needed to represent an aspect or a multitude of aspects of our identity. I used the facial mesh from the tensorflow.js library to create a mask that didn't cover my face but showed a variety of identities I take on in various aspects of life. 

As a woman in today's world, I find that I need to compartmentalize myself to exist safely in spaces. When I am working at a dental office or babysitting for parents I need to constantly be a people pleaser regardless of what is being said to me. In the office setting I had people call me "honey" and make other slightly demeaning remarks that I couldn't respond to due to professionalism. Online and in gaming spaces, I have to present myself in a more masculine way to avoid verbal harassment. I work very hard to mask and cover these emotions. Sometimes I struggle with feeling grounded and present as I struggle with OCD and anxiety. Other times I struggle with gender identity and expression. All these faces in my project represent the variety of masks I have to put on eveyday to exist in a variety of different places.
